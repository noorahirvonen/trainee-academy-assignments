## Frontend portfolio - Noora Hirvonen

This repository includes examples of working with JavaScript, HTML & CSS. A short overview is provided in this document, and the executable versions are found in the repository. I have included the instructions as written in the assignments and separate introductory words by myself, as well as short descriptions of why I wrote the code as I did. 


## Assignment: Reverse words

This assignment was about coming up with an appropriate sorting algorithm to reverse words in a given sentence, without altering the the order of the words, which made it more advanced than a simple palindrome. 

*Create a function `reverseWords` that reverses each word in a string, but does not reverse the order of the words in the string.*

```js
const sentence = "this is a short sentence";
const reversed = reverseWords(sentence);
console.log(reversed); // prints "siht si a trohs ecnetnes"
```

## Assignment: Dumb chatbot

The task was to reate a chatbot command line program with pre-determined commands and their resulting output. I have referenced the assignment here shortly, but I left most of the instructions out, since they were mainly descriptive of what the various commands should do. The code used in executing these tasks was left up to the writer to decide.

The instructions introduced a readline-sync package, which makes user input possible.

# The command line application
*This is a really common exercise that almost every programmer does at some point in their career. The reason itâ€™s so common, is because through this you have to use a lot of different types of variables and various operations.*
